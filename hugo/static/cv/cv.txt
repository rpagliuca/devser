I am Rafael J P dos Santos, 32 years old, from São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil.

I have been a Tech Lead for the past two years, and in this current role I have led
the migration of our previous monolith system to a new microservices architecture,
composed of Kubernetes, Docker, Golang, Golang Standard Testing Library, MongoDB,
Prometheus, Grafana, AWS SQS, AWS SNS, AWS EC2, AWS S3, Kops, ReactJS, and
Jenkins for an automated deploy pipeline (CD), among other technologies.
