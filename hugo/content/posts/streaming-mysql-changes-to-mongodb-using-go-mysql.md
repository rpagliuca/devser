I've setup a proof-of-concept environment with docker-compose, for streaming MySQL data changes into a MongoDB collection.

It's based on the great <a href="https://github.com/siddontang/go-mysql">go-mysql library</a>.

You can check out the project code in here:

Also, here is a videocast of the project up and running:
